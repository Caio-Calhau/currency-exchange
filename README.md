# Action Labs BRL Exchange Rate

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Description

This is a currency converter web application built as part of an interview project. The main goal is to allow users to convert various international currencies into Brazilian Real (BRL) using real-time exchange rates.

This is my first project using Angular, and it gave me hands-on experience with Angular's component system, services, HTTP requests.

## Supported Currencies

You can test the converter with the following currency codes:

- USD – US Dollar
- EUR – Euro
- GBP – British Pound
- JPY – Japanese Yen
- CAD – Canadian Dollar

## Limits

- Currently, the list that displays the exchange rates from the past 30 days is incomplete.
- Due to time constraints, I was not able to fully implement this feature, but I plan to improve it in future versions.
